# ClanGen CatMaker

### By: Keyraven 

Current version: 0.4.0beta

ClanGen Catmaker allows you to create cats using [ClanGen's](https://sablesteel.itch.io/clan-gen-fan-edit) art assets! All created cats are valid to create in [ClanGen](https://sablesteel.itch.io/clan-gen-fan-edit). 

Future Plans:
- Save created cats to revist them later. 
- Export cats as .json files that can be copy and pasted into ClanGen save files. 
- Export Cats as transparent png. 


Please don't sell any images created, and provide proper attribution.
